#about
aboutText=Hi! I'm Serban, an IT enthusiast currently studying at TU-CN and working part time at msg-systems Romania.\n\n\
I have always been interested in computers and, since high school, programming has been my main passion. During the recent years, \
I've worked with many programming languages and many technologies. I believe that a programmer must be versatile and using all sorts \
of languages, ranging from 1st generation machine language to 4th generation languages like ABAP or PHP, strengthens one's versatility. \n\n\
This very website was built by me from scratch in an attempt to share (and show off) my work and knowledge. All the projects listed \
here are exclusively developed in my spare time. No work or school related projects are mentioned yet (albeit a couple of the projects \
are based on an idea sparked from some school project). I hope you'll like this site :)

prjWebPaint=Web-based Paint
prjWebPaintDescr=It started as a simple Java Application for college. Then I decided to try to move the functionality to a HTML 5 app. \
It allows the user to draw using simple shapes (rectangle, circle, line, etc), more complex shapes (stars, stickmen, etc) and even to \
import external pictures. The user can also resize, move and change the colors of the shapes, use undo-redo functionality, save and load \
drawing files (.json format) and also to export to PNG.
prjWebPaintLang=HTML5, JS, UI5
prjWebPaintS1=The main drawing area of the application, with the shape palette on the top and the objects' properties on the left.

prjGDE=Graphical Development Environment
prjGDEDescr=An application which can be used to write imperative Java code by dragging and dropping functional blocks. \
The generated code can also be displayed inside the application, compiled and run. The front-end is done in HTML5 and the \
back-end is built in Java (it consists of an embedded HTTP server).
prjGDELang=Java, HTML5, JS, UI5
prjGDES1=The drag-and-drop area of the application. The functional blocks can be dragged from the menu strip on the right \
and properties of each block can be set using the Properties toolbox. Blocks can be moved and their contents explored.
prjGDES2=The generated code area (corresponding to the previous schematic).
prjGDES3=The console area after compiling and running the Java schematic (can be done using either buttons or console commands).

prjEvid=Job Registry
prjEvidDescr=This project was built in my spare time for a relative of mine which is a land surveyor. Using it, one can keep \
track of all jobs and court terms for judicial expertise jobs. It offers a calendar for seeing court dates and automatically reads \
data from the Ministry of Justice Web API and the National Agency for Cadaster and Land Registration website to update \
the data accordingly. 
prjEvidLang=PHP, MySQL, JS
prjEvidS1=The job registry. Each line represents a job. The user can search through the jobs, add a new one, sort them, \
edit, delete or expand a job to see further attributes.
prjEvidS2=An expanded job, showing the data retrieved from the Agency's website (the last row).
prjEvidS3=A fast entry screen, which can be used to enter the inquiry number for a job (after it was given to the Agency).
prjEvidS4=A fast entry screen, which can be used to change the status of a job.
prjEvidS5=The court terms calendar. 

prjFact=Invoice Generator
prjFactDescr=This is an application built on top of OpenOffice which can be used to manage invoices for \
a small company. It allows the user to define multiple profiles, it keeps track of customer data (for recurring customers) \
and generates OpenOffice files with the invoices (using a user-defined template).
prjFactLang=Basic, OpenOffice API
prjFactS1=The profile creation / modification screen.
prjFactS2=The main screen. Allows the user to enter various data related to the invoice, to save, restore, print or even \
create a receipt for the invoice (opens a separate application). A summary of all invoices can also be generated.
prjFactS3=A demo invoice generated by the program.
prjFactS4=A demo invoice summary also generated by the program.

prjChit=Receipt Generator
prjChitDescr=A sister-application (for generating receipts) of the invoice generation. Either standalone receipts \
or receipts derived from an invoice can be created. 
prjChitLang=Basic, OpenOffice API
prjChitS1=The data entry screen (fields are auto-filled if the receipt is derived from an invoice).
prjChitS2=A demo receipt generated by the program.

prjForm=Generic Document Generator
prjFormDescr=A application for land surveyors built on top of OpenOffice, which takes input values from the user and optionally \
an XML file (generated by some external program) and generates documents using user specified templates. The values \
given by the user or read from the XML are either filled directly in the templates or are used to build tables \
and hide / show sections. 
prjFormLang=Basic, OpenOffice API, C / C++
prjFormS1=The static input fields of the generator.
prjFormS2=The file selection, template selection and the input field for the optional XML file.
prjFormS3=The output of the generator.

prjSrv=Server Manager
prjSrvDescr=A program specifically designed to manage dedicated servers for a video game that I played some time ago (Mount and Blade \
Warband). It allowed the simultaneous management of several servers, checking the logs, creating reports, scheduling start, stop or \
restart actions.
prjSrvLang=C#
prjSrvS1=The first screen of the program. Allows the user to add or remove servers, to view the current status or to edit configurations.
prjSrvS2=The redirected console of the selected server (both input and output).
prjSrvS3=The event scheduler for the selected server.
prjSrvS4=The event log for a server.

prjSwa=Swadian Roleplay Mod
prjSwaDescr=This was a very complex project in which I was involved in my early development career. It was a mod (custom module) for \
Mount and Blade Warband which aimed to completely change the game concept without forcing players to download anything. For this \
project, I was the sole developer (even though multiple other people supported the mod in various other ways). It consisted of \
modified Python scripts which were run by the server, PHP administration consoles, C / C++ log parsers. At some point, I have \
also injected assembly code inside the binaries of the game itself to add some missing features which could not be achieved with \
the python scripts.
prjSwaLang=Python, C / C++, PHP, MySQL, Assembly
